                <p>Waves was made to give people the chance to simply relax and destress. Waves is a simple but powerful meditation website that helps people with preserving mental health and capacity. Waves has many exercises for you to go through with yoga and meditation made to help the mind. Too many people suffer from mental health issues and I tell all of those people to try meditation, but most people brush it off and say that won't work for me and never try it. Waves is simple enough that anyone can use it and that was intentional. Anyone and Everyone should use waves and start or continue there path to a healthier happier life</p>
